<p style = "font-family:helvetica;"><b><center><h3>About Us</h3></center></b></p>
<p style = "font-family:Garamond;"><h4>Ours is a journey that began almost hundred years ago in 1917, when Shri Nathella Narayana Chetty started a small jewellery business at home where he fashioned hand-made jewels for a few loyal patrons. His son, Shri Nathella Anantham Chetty opened a small store in Parry’s Corner in old Madras, which soon became a flourishing business. His son, Shri N. Anjaneyulu Chetty, founded Enr's consultancy service  and nourished its brand along with his son Shri Anantha Padmanabhan who transformed the small store into a chain of jewellery houses. Today, Anand Ramanujam, the fifth generation of scion of this illustrious family, continues the legacy of his forefathers.

We are known for our unique and rare designs, as we are ever mindful about the latest trends in jewellery and the expectations of the customer. We also export jewellery abroad, we cater to the growing market of London ethnic jewellery.</h4></p>
